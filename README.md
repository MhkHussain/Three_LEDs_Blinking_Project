## Components:
- Three LED Lights
- Resistors of 220 ohms
- Male to Male Jumper Wires
- Arduino

## About:
In this project, I have connected three different LED lights and three resistors of 220 ohms and then I upload a code on arduino in which I initialize three LEDs with three arduino pins. Then declared LEDpin as an OUTPUT and then for the continuation of process I put three LEDs n the DisplayWrite, also gave the delay of 3 sec for switc-on the light and 1 sec for off. 

## Summary:
According to my code, three Led lights will blink one by one and then all three LEDs will blink together.
